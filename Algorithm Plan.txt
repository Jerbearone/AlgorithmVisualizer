Binary search scenario:

	The problem: So one of our employees assigned someone a storage unit about a month ago. 
	The customer has never seen this storage unit, since he hired someone to store the items for them,
	Normally they would have a unit number, but all they have is the ID of the storage unit.
	You as the employee know that the units are in numberical order, but don't have information on exactly where the unit is.
	Another problem is that the company has 250 units, so searching these 1 by 1 could take days... Luckily for us, were programmers.
	Lets see how a binary search can solve this problem!
